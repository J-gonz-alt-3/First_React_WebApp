# Completed Project

First ReactJS project I've completed!

My hope is that this project displays competency creating Responsive WebApps using ReactJS.

For those not familiar with what I mean by "Responsive", it simply means that as the screen real estate changes, the site will adjust with it. Maintaining readability and functionality for the user (regardless of the device or window size of the site).

If you would like to test it out, simply open this webpage up on any browser of your liking and start adjusting the window size from full screen, to half the screen, to really small, and everything in between!

Watch as the web app starts adjusting the content accordingly.

# Code Roadmap

Most of the important/relevant code is in the src folder.

Webpage components are broken down into sections within the "components" and "containers" sub folders.

For an overall webpage structure, you can checkout the App.js file within my src folder.

I also have an "assets" folder within the src folder, however this is mainly to hold my .png files that I would later use within my webpage.

********************************************************************************************

# Project Goal

To practice Webpage structuring within ReactJS, so that I can build good habits that will help simplify my development for not only this project but for any other future dev project.

I believe this project also serves as great practice with refining my CSS skills (specifically with regards to mobile device handling Ex: @media).

# Closing Remarks

I will be working on this project on a daily basis until completion.

Please ignore all text below this line, as it was (Auto-Generated by React), however I want to keep it for my own reference moving forward!

Thank you for taking the time to look at my code! :)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
